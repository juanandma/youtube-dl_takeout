# youtube-dl_takeout

This Python script allows you to download all Youtube videos from a Google Takeout yt playlist csv file, in this case the Liked Videos.csv which contains all the videos that your yt account likes.

There is also a Linux Bash file with the same functionality, but it requires that you first remove the header (first 5 lines) from your Google Takeout file.

Requires:

    Python 3 or Bash

    youtube-dl standard installation or via pip
